I've used the Eclipse IDE and Lombok plugin. If you need to install the plugin follow these steps:
 * Go to Help menu > Install new software > Add https://projectlombok.org/p2 > Install the Lombok plugin
 * Check the checkbox and follow the steps. It will ask to restart Eclipse.
 * Once it is restarted, right click on project, Update Maven (and if not setup for automatic rebuild, Clean the project).


Please execute the unit tests in /src/test/java/com/toolstore/service/StoreTest
